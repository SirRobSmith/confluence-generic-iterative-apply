# confluence-generic-iterative-apply
A simple and flexible tool to iteratively apply settings to confluence pages which respects the nested nature of the structure. 

Yes, it'd be lovely if Confluence automations provided this functionality for us - alas no. Page Branching in its current form merely iterates over pages which match a small number of criteria. Whereas what I'd find useful would be the ability to execute against pages with a fixed level 0 parent. 

This little tool helps with this.
